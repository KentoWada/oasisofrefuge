    </div>
    <p>This is a charity instituted in 2023, an idea birthed by Joshua Dikia and he's associates.
        With support from the nationals and global aid, it has continued to grow into a more reputable and non-selective unifying bodyencompassing multitudes of the desolate and unfortunate families or individuals incapacitated by life battles.
        The organisation is channelled to operate in the northern half of the country but in the due course, God-willing, will radiate traversing the entire central, eastern, western and southern parts of the nation with consideration of the countries.</p>

    <div class="titlesdiv">
